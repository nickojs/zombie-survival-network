# SNI WebApp
This SPA was developed using React Hooks with TypeScript, Context API, react-hook-forms, react-rnd, socket.io, styled-components, and some other awesome libs. 

# Setting up
1. Clone the project
2. Run `yarn` and then, after the installation, `yarn start`
3. Make sure the backend is live before starting the webapp
4. You may need to change the .env values for your own values

# Final considerations
I wish I could make this project available, but my free GCP tier expired these days, and I couldn't set up a VPS from scratch - had problems with SSL and VM's specs (too expensive).
